# EEG Bad Channel Detection State-of-the-art Methods

This repository provides state-of-the-art traditional methods to detect and remove bad channels in scalp EEG using EEGLAB.

## Methods Included In This Repository
1. **Kurtosis Measure (2006)**
2. **FASTER Algorithm (2010)**
3. **ASR Clean_rawdata Plugin (PREP-2015)**
4. **HAPPE (2018)**

## Software Dependencies
1. **EEGLAB**: [Download EEGLAB](https://sccn.ucsd.edu/eeglab/download.php)
2. **FASTER Code Implementation**: [Download FASTER](https://sourceforge.net/projects/faster/)

## Use Case: Running the FASTER Pipeline
To run the FASTER pipeline:

1. Open `run_FASTER.m`
2. Set the root location of data and label files
3. Execute the file
4. The results (balanced accuracy and F1 score) can be found in the `result_FASTER.mat` file

## Important Update

In our attempts to find a robust bad channel detection method, we adapted the LOF (Local Outlier Factor) to EEG for the first time and we found much improved performance compared to the existing approaches. The code is freely available as an EEGLAB plugin ([here](https://github.com/vpKumaravel/detectbadchannelLOF)) and also a part of MNE-Python preprocessing routine ([here](https://github.com/mne-tools/mne-python/blob/main/mne/preprocessing/_lof.py#L15-L99)).
